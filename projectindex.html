<h1>What is the "Ground Effect"?</h1>
  <p>Ground effect is an aerodynamic occurence that happens when there is a substantial pressure differential between a body and the fluid
  moving past it when close to the ground surface specifically. A plane wing is the body in this case and the pressure differential causes
  a difference in air flow around the body itself. This can mean a lower pressure leads to greater velocities of air travelling over the top
  of one side of the wing and slower moving air underneath. This causes a lift effect from Newton's third law as every reaction must have an
  equal reaction in the opposite direction as the wing forces air to the ground and the ground exerts a force back on the wing through air.</p>
  <h2>Facts:</h2>
  <ul>
    - Ground effect only occurs when travelling at low altitudes
    - The phenomenon is known to be called a mattress or cushion
    - The effect gives a floating sensation
