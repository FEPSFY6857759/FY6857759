            Understanding the ground effect in the take-off and landing of aeroplanes is necessary in figuring out why it is so useful in modern aviation. This paper aims to assess the extent
            to which ground effect is useful in take-off and landing of airplanes. The ground effect is an aerodynamic effect when an aircraft flies close to the ground and causes the airflow
            to behave differently with increased lift and reduced drag causing the aircraft to maintain flight with less thrust or fuel consumption (Guo Kexin et al, 2022). The premise of ground
            effect has been studied in engineering throughout the century with studies from the 1940s being recorded (Flaps2Approach, 2012).

            Ground effect is a phenomenon that has saved lives and which was not fully understood until later years (Flaps2Approach, 2012). Aircraft utilize this effect and not many people
            understand what it is; without ground effect there would be a number of difficulties with air travel primarily involving take-off and landing. The impact of ground effect can be
            changed based on aircraft that vary in wing configurations, specifically WIG planes (Wing-in-ground effect) (Allen Herbert, 2018). The safety of flight at airports must rely on this
            effect which cannot be seen and is basic in principle.

            Ground effect occurs when aircraft fly close to the ground, this causes a cushion of air due to a pressure differential (Guo Kexin et al, 2022). ...
