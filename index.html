            Understanding the ground effect in the take-off and landing of aeroplanes is necessary in figuring out why it is so useful in modern aviation. This paper aims to assess the extent
            to which ground effect is useful in take-off and landing of airplanes. The ground effect is an aerodynamic effect when an aircraft flies close to the ground and causes the airflow
            to behave differently with increased lift and reduced drag causing the aircraft to maintain flight with less thrust or fuel consumption (Guo Kexin et al, 2022). The premise of ground
            effect has been studied in engineering throughout the century with studies from the 1940s being recorded (Flaps2Approach, 2012). 
            </pre>

        <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
            <pre id="Introduction">
            Ground effect is a phenomenon that has saved lives and which was not fully understood until later years (Flaps2Approach, 2012). Aircraft utilize this effect and not many people
            understand what it is; without ground effect there would be a number of difficulties with air travel primarily involving take-off and landing. The impact of ground effect can be
            changed based on aircraft that vary in wing configurations, specifically WIG planes (Wing-in-ground effect) (Allen Herbert, 2018). The safety of flight at airports must rely on this
            effect which cannot be seen and is basic in principle.
            </pre>

        <h3 id="Analysis and Discussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3>
            <pre id="Analysis">
            Ground effect occurs when aircraft fly close to the ground, this causes a cushion of air due to a pressure differential (Guo Kexin et al, 2022). The differential is from the change
            in airspeed as it travels over the wing, as the plane forces high pressure air towards the ground; the ground forces air back up onto the underneath of the wings forming a Newton’s
            law pair and hence reducing drag and increasing lift (Joseph E Burnside, 2019). There is intensified lift caused by the pressure increase on the undersurface of the wing from greater
            deceleration of air between the ground and wing (Liang Yun et al, 2010).
            
            This generated lift is affected by the shape of the wing as well as its size, angle and conditions of the atmosphere (Tom Benson, Ruth Peterson, 2021). This effect is beneficial during take-off
            as it allows the aircraft to lift off at a lower airspeed and continue accelerating before it begins climbing reducing the chance of stalling (Tom Benson, Ruth Peterson, 2021). 
            This is especially useful in soft-field take-offs where ground friction is higher and a lower take-off speed is achieved (Tom Benson, Ruth Peterson, 2021).
            
            During landing, ground effect significantly impacts aircraft performance by increasing lift and reducing drag as the aircraft descends close to the ground. The proximity of the wings to
            the ground also decreases the downwash effect on landing. This is caused by the deflection of air towards the ground, the reduction in downwash is because airflow between the wing and ground
            has less space to fully deflect downward (Tom Benson, Ruth Peterson, 2021).  Downwash refers to when there is the right humidity and so the vortex lines are visible on planes during landing,
            eddies produce a downwash of air behind the wing edge (Tom Benson, Ruth Peterson, 2021). Pilots account for this by adjusting descent speeds to not exceed the runway or encounter a rough
            landing (Joseph E Burnside, 2019).
            
            The impact of ground effect varies based on design, particularly between low-wing and high-wing configurations (Allen Herbert, 2018). Low-wing aircraft experience more pronounced ground effect
            as the wings are closer to the surface, increasing lift and reducing drag significantly during take-off and landing but it can cause floating effects due to stronger ground effect
            (Allen Herbert, 2018). High-wing aircraft, are less affected as their wings are positioned higher, reducing the intensity of ground effect (Allen Herbert, 2018). Factors like wing aspect
            ratio and sweep (angle of wing) also influence the effect, the aspect ratio refers to the square of the span of the wing divided by the area of the wing (Tom Benson et al, 1997). 
            
            WIG planes typically use this, an example of the use are Ekranoplans which is a Russian name referring to “a lifting surface close to a ground plane” (Liang Yun et al, 2010). Planes that utilize the
            reduced drag and enhanced lift so that low-altitude flight can be achieved, most of the vehicles which use this fly over water (Liang Yun et al, 2010).
            
            Safety is paramount when designing aircraft that use ground effect, planning is required so that pilots are aware to transition into and out of this effect when flying, they must account for stalls
            (Jeff Scott, 2002). Stall speed refers to the slowest velocity that an aircraft can travel at to become airborne (Jeff Scott, 2002). When taking off, an aeroplane can stall if it doesn’t have enough
            lift and this effect increases lift to reduce the stall speed hence pilots can fly close to the ground and accelerate until they can ascend (Monroe Aerospace, 2015). Large passenger planes vary in 
            take-off speeds due to weight and shape; for a Boeing 737 the minimum speed for ascending is 150mph, and the stall speed is reduced from take-off when ground effect occurs (Jeff Scott, 2002). “However, 
            a good average speed range is about 160 mph to 180 mph" (Jeff Scott, 2002). The lift coefficient values generated with a flap angle of 5-10 degrees are in a range of 2-2.5, “Even the slightest change
            in the orientation of the plane or the condition of its control surfaces will cause the wing to lose lift and the aircraft will drop back onto the runway” (Jeff Scott, 2002). An example of this effect 
            was the Concorde having a pitched nose angled downwards. Aerodynamic effects allowed travel at Mach speeds, the nose allowed take-off and landing with this cushion effect; it utilized separated air 
            along the trailing edge of the nose and would cause stationary air to get squashed, raising the pressure and increasing lift (Michael Riley, 2024). Concorde would take-off at 225mph despite having a
            181,435 kg weight (Jeff Scott, 2002). The take-off speeds will vary because of the weight and aerodynamic effects provided by ground effect, but it can be said that increased ground effect allows for
            heavier planes to take-off more quickly.

            The underlying problems with ground effect are outweighed by the benefits of having an aerodynamic phenomenon to support the plane upon landing and take-off. Whilst ground effect causes a floating
            effect upon landing and can cause overshooting (Allen Herbert, 2018); it allows a reduction in take-off speed needing a shorter runway. As the plane can take-off at  lower airspeeds it allows for a
            smoother take-off meaning it’s safer for passengers on board as well as being more comfortable due to less turbulence on take-off (Tom Benson,  Ruth Peterson, 2021).  An increase in lift means an
            aeroplane can take-off and land at lower speeds than it could if flying higher, which improves control and reduces the risk of stalling at lower altitudes (Joseph E Burnside, 2019).
